Living cross culturally gave me many challenges and experiences both as a believer and an educator. I prefer to attend national churches and try my best to learn the language spoken locally.

335	Educator Comments	Dear Sir or Madam: Thank you for considering my profile. It is my desire to serve in Christian Education where the vision for academic excellence is realized in the context of a biblical worldview. As a technology teacher and web developer, I see great potential for kingdom work but also the urgent need to help young people develop into responsible citizens ready to harness the power of technology while also being able to self regulate their usage. The most valuable strength I bring to the table from an educational standpoint is my sincere love for the content I teach. I make it a priority to stay abreast of technological trends in education as well and in industry. I have industry-standard certification in the field of web development and enjoy experimenting with new technologies to create engaging learning experiences that meet expected outcomes, while being enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoy integrating a biblical worldview into the content and am eager to be in an environment to do this again.
