School Info
66	Description	Whitman Academy is a small international Christian school located in Amman, Jordan which serves over 100 families. Our school plays a profoundly fundamental and unique role in supporting Kingdom workers to thrive in Jordan (and the Middle East). We provide an excellent Christian education in English to Third-Culture-Kids. There are scarce schooling alternatives and our school is growing. The need for teachers may increase as regional conflict has resulted in more workers coming to Jordan- a comparatively safe country. Opportunities for ministry, especially among refugees have widened, and Jordan has continued to enjoy a reputation for safety and peace in the midst of a region that has long been in the news for its conflict. We are seeking talented educators with a heart for serving TCKS and a desire to use their gifts to impact kingdom work in the Middle East.
