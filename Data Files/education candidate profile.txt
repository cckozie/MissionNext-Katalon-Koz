Life Experience:   In 2008 I accepted Jesus as King and savior of my life. Before I met the Lord my life was very opaque, hazy, empty and very worried about the future. Most of the time I felt sadness and negativity for any unfavorable situation. Most of the time I thought about things of extreme doom, as if nothing in life had meaning or importance. I met people who lived in luxury, but were not happy, then those people died and their family enjoyed the goods. For things like the previous one I thought that life was a disaster, I had many negative thoughts, such as imagining that it was better not to be alive. I also had a lot of nightmares and felt noise in my room when I was sleeping. I felt these things for a long time, but even without being a Christian, when I cried out to God I stopped fearing and those disturbances disappeared.
